  "description": "Dante Alighieri's *The Divine Comedy* is a long narrative poem divided into three parts: *Inferno* (Hell), *Purgatorio* (Purgatory), and *Paradiso* (Paradise). It depicts Dante's allegorical journey through the afterlife, guided by Virgil and later Beatrice, exploring themes of sin, redemption, and the nature of God. The poem is a cornerstone of Italian literature and a profound exploration of medieval Christian beliefs.",
